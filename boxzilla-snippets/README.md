Code snippets for Boxzilla
==========================

This is a repository of code snippets that help modify the default behaviour of the [Boxzilla plugin](https://boxzillaplugin.com/) &amp; its [add-ons](https://boxzillaplugin.com/add-ons/).

Snippets are organized into categories (folders) and each snippet is placed in its own file with a filename that describes what the code snippet does.

## Using snippets

Most files in this library contain code that you can add to the `functions.php` file of your active theme unless stated otherwise. 

1. Click on the filename of the snippet you'd like to use.
2. Click the "Raw" button (next to "Blame" and "History") at the top right.
3. Copy the code and add it to the end of the file named `functions.php` inside the folder of your activated theme: `/wp-content/themes/your-theme/functions.php`
